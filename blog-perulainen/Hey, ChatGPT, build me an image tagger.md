My research team needs to filter and tag a large set of images—6,196 to be precise. The project deadline is approaching, so we require a free, simple, and effective tool to process this dataset on time.

It’s been a while since I’ve worked with such a large dataset. For most of my research projects, Miro suffices, but 6,000 images would overwhelm its virtual sticky notes. Years ago, I tried Atlas.ti, and it was okay… but I no longer have a license. I also tested freemium solutions, but synchronizing data wasn’t feasible (or affordable).

Last week, I used ChatGPT—and DeepSeek to a lesser extent—to create a web application for our research project.
## Generating apps
For mediocre developers like me, AI makes it surprisingly easy to create fully functional apps. A few weeks ago, I built a Python PDF splitter with a single prompt, just for fun. Now, I have a local version of ilovepdf.com running on my server.

“Poké Tagger” is an app built with React, Apache, and MySQL. It allows my team to upload, search, filter, tag images, and generate reports.

The irony? Most of its code was generated using ChatGPT (v1) and DeepSeek (R1). It took four days, copious coffee, and patience, but the effort paid off. While the app isn’t secure by professional standards, it’s robust enough for two users. Performance can lag due to unoptimized code and database quirks, but overall, Poké Tagger meets our needs (and even displays our profile pictures!).

If people can generate software via prompts, what does this mean for developers? A few years ago, Peru’s government attempted to develop open-source tools to digitize pharmacy prescriptions for under-resourced local governments. A software developers’ guild protested, arguing the state was distorting the market by creating free solutions. Today, technical experts in those same regions could build their own tools. Is this the decline of “traditional” software companies?

More critically, AI-generated software underscores a deeper issue: infrastructure costs. While AI reduces reliance on developers, it doesn’t eliminate the need for computers, electricity, networks, and processing power. Who controls these resources? Are they accessible to everyone? For how long?

It’s time to reframe the debate.
